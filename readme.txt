Project is built using bootstrap and you can run it on your local server. Currently, I have not yet added database configurations
as yet, but will do as I make progress with it.

The file I need help on is the invoice.html, on click of the add button I need it to add an extra row duplicated from the parent row.

NOT: DOES NOT REQUIRE MIGRATIONS.
